##_Technical_ _Background_
I havn't coded much, as I am a minor in CS. I just know the job opportunities and
skill set that comes with learning how to code so I thought I would minor in it.
Hopefully I can still land a job, Im more focused with learning new things outside
of school as well like Amazon certifications and genrally building a portfolio of projects.
Working with AI working really cool especially with how fast it is evolving.
